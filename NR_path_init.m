% script NR_path_init
% Initialize the path environment for using the Numerical Renaissance (NR) codebase.
% You can check your path in Matlab at any time by typing "path".
%
% Since the NR codebase builds on the RR codebase, you must also download and install that.
%
% You should call both the RR and NR path init codes automatically when firing up Matlab on your computer,
% by appending calls to RR_path_init and NR_path_init in the startup.m file of your userpath directory.
% Matlab provides guidance on this subject here:  https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/startup.html
%
% In short, fire up Matlab, and type the command 'userpath', which will return the name of a directory.
% WITHIN THAT DIRECTORY (important!), edit the file startup.m (or, create a file of this name
% if one doesn't already exist); this file should contain (at least) the following two lines:
%    RRbase='/Users/bewley/RR'; cd(RRbase); RR_path_init
%    NRbase='/Users/bewley/NR'; cd(NRbase); NR_path_init
% NOTE: replace the directory names in single quotes above with the full paths to the locations
% that you have installed the RR and NR codebases on your computer.  Note that forward slashes (/),
% as shown above, are used on Macs, whereas backslashes (\) are used in Windows; on a Windows machine,
% the full path to one of these directories might look something like, e.g., 'C:\Users\bewley\NR'
% Note you can also put other commonly needed Matlab initialization commands in your startup.m file.
